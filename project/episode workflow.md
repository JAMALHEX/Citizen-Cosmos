### Basic episode workflow

This concerns native marketing and community building, not paid marketing of the episode

1) Find a guest in accordance to [relevant topics](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/Citizen-Cosmos/blob/master/project/relevant%20podcast%20topics.md) or / and [guest wish list](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/Citizen-Cosmos/blob/master/community/guest-wish-list.md)
2) Establish basic contact with the guest via any means of communication (ask for email)
3) After an agreement to participate in the show, [@serejandmyself](https://github.com/serejandmyself) sends out an official CC invite
4) Record the episode
5) Edit the episode [@aha203](https://github.com/Aha203)
6) Publish the episode [@serejandmyself](https://github.com/serejandmyself)
7) Sharing of the episode with the Cosmos community and on CC SM.
8) Marketing the episode. This means finding any relevant communities on SM, such as, Twitter, Reddit, forums, etc. Finding relevant topics with those communities and sharing the link to the episode with them
9) Possibly create some cuttings out of the episode to share, like quotes or memes or anything similar. Share those with relevant communities
10) Publish a review of the episode and share it on SM and with any relevant communties.
