# Citizen Cosmos: brand roadmap

## Goal

Helping to discover web3 via the means of communication. Citizen Cosmos stated as [a podcast](https://www.citizencosmos.space/), helping the curious to discover the Cosmos ecosystem via personal stories of web3 builders, their ambitions to turn code into reality. Citizen Cosmos grew into a brand, helping with the formation of community and the ecosystem by securing and supporting various ecosystem networks as a validator, and by running such initiatives, as the organization of local meetups, social media management, translations, etc. Our aim is to make web3 an everyday instrument in people life, by using it, becoming a part of it and helping others to journey with us.
